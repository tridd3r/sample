I've attached a sample jquery function and a sample php file. 
I'd like you to convert the jquery to plain ES6 compliant javascript and provide any improvements you can add to the sample.js.

With the php, can you please comment the code explaining what everything (within reason) is doing, and include any suggestions or improvements where possible. 
I'll leave the amount of comments expected up to you, but I'm explicitly looking for your understanding of the code.
